# TwoNote - Notes and Markdown Editor

### About
This project originally started as an exercise from the [freeCodeCamp React Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&list=PL3mY6d1fMqmIN7e8w-_p_F9qwjqvYBbFd&index=2) but then I decided to build this project from scratch as a challenge so here it is.
